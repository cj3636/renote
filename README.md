# Renote

 A minimalist, fast note cards web app. Every keystroke is saved instantly to Redis (hot working set) and persisted asynchronously to MariaDB via a write‑behind stream worker. Offline‑friendly (localStorage), modern glassmorphic dark UI, precise drag & drop ordering (placeholder + commit on drop), soft delete with recovery history.

## Features

- Instant persistence: localStorage + Redis per keystroke (debounced network ~450ms)
- Asynchronous durability via Redis Streams → MariaDB write‑behind worker
- Dark single‑page UI (no framework) with glass / blur aesthetic & minimal JS
- Precision drag & drop (handle only) with real‑time placeholder and commit‑on‑drop bulk order sync
- Modal editor with fullscreen toggle and double‑confirm delete
- Optional card name (title) + automatic blurb preview (first sentence)
- Soft delete: removed from Redis but recoverable from MariaDB until flush purges

- Flush button (debug mode) now also triggers an immediate state re‑sync after write‑behind flush
- Health indicator (lag classification: ok / degraded / backlog)
- Adaptive stream flush batch sizing
- Stream trimming to prevent unbounded growth

---

## Quick Start (Development)

Assumes: PHP 8.1+, Redis, MariaDB running locally (TCP or sockets). For quick experimentation you can skip MariaDB initially (some features will be limited).

1. Create your env file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with Redis/MariaDB credentials (never commit real secrets)
```

1. Install dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

1. Create database + table (adjust database/user if changed):

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS pnotes CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
USE pnotes;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cards (
  id         VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
  name       VARCHAR(255) NULL,
  txt        MEDIUMTEXT NOT NULL,
  `order`    INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  updated_at BIGINT NOT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
```

1. Run a PHP dev server (or use Apache/Nginx):

```bash
php -S localhost:8080 index.php
```

1. Open <http://localhost:8080> and start adding cards.

2. Manually flush (in debug mode) via the ⟳ button or CLI:

```bash
php flush.php --once
```

> For development you may set `APP_DEBUG=true` in `.env` to reveal debug & history controls.

---

## Production Deployment

Recommend Nginx → PHP‑FPM. Place project in `/var/www/renote` (or similar). Use systemd timer to run `flush.php --once` every few minutes (batch mode) or run continuously in continuous mode.

Example Nginx server block (minimal):

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name notes.example.com;
  root /var/www/renote;
  index index.php;

  location / { try_files $uri /index.php; }

  location ~ \.php$ {
    include fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php-fpm.sock; # adjust
  }
}
```

### systemd (batch flush)

`docs/renote.service` (oneshot) and `docs/renote.timer` are provided. Install & enable:

```bash
sudo cp docs/renote.service docs/renote.timer /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now renote.timer
```

Adjust interval in `renote.timer` to match `APP_BATCH_FLUSH_EXPECTED_INTERVAL` (default 180s) for accurate health status.

---

## Configuration

All runtime settings now come from environment variables (`.env` in development). `config.php` loads and maps them to legacy constants so existing code continues to function. See `.env.example` for the full list and descriptions.

Key environment variables:

- Redis: `REDIS_CONNECTION`, `REDIS_SOCKET`, `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_USERNAME`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`
- MariaDB: `DB_USE_SOCKET`, `DB_SOCKET`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_SSL_ENABLE`, `DB_SSL_VERIFY`, `DB_SSL_CA`, `DB_SSL_CRT`, `DB_SSL_KEY`
- Worker: `APP_WRITE_BEHIND`, `APP_WRITE_BEHIND_MODE`, `APP_STREAM_MAXLEN`, `WORKER_MAX_BATCH`, `WORKER_TRIM_EVERY`, `WORKER_BLOCK_MS`
- Health thresholds: `WORKER_MIN_OK_LAG`, `WORKER_MIN_DEGRADED_LAG`, `BATCH_FLUSH_EXPECTED_INTERVAL`
- Pruning / limits: `PRUNE_EMPTY`, `EMPTY_MINLEN`, `APP_CARD_MAX_LEN`
- Rate limiting & validation: `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX`, `APP_REQUIRE_UUID`
- Debug UI: `APP_DEBUG`

Systemd: copy `.env` to `/etc/renote.env` (or similar) and the provided `renote.service` will load it via `EnvironmentFile=-/etc/renote.env`.

## Data Model & Architecture

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Browser localStorage | Immediate offline resilience / rapid UX feedback |
| Redis Hash `card:<id>` | Authoritative hot state (fields: id, name, text, order, updated_at) |
| Redis Sorted Set `cards:index` | Global ordering of card IDs |
| Redis Stream `cards:stream` | Append‑only change log for write‑behind worker |
| MariaDB `cards` table | Durable persistence & history recovery |

Flow:

1. User types → JS updates local state + debounced `save_card` to API
2. API writes Redis hash + index and appends to stream (or writes DB directly if write‑behind disabled)
3. Worker consumes stream entries grouping by card id (coalesced) → UPSERT / DELETE in MariaDB
4. Deletions: removing from Redis (soft delete) is later detected as missing hash during flush and DB row is purged (unless restored first)

---

## API Overview (JSON)

| Action | Method | Params / Body | Notes |
|--------|--------|---------------|-------|
| `state` | GET | – | Full current state (Redis bootstrap) |
| `save_card` | POST | `{id,name?,text,order}` | Upsert one card (ID + size validated) |
| `bulk_save` | POST | `{cards:[...]}` | Order + batch upserts (invalid cards skipped) |
| `delete_card` | POST | `{id}` | Soft delete (Redis only) |
| `history` | GET | – | DB rows not in Redis |
| `history_restore` | POST | `{id}` | Rehydrate row into Redis (debug mode only) |
| `history_purge` | POST | `{id}` | Permanently remove DB row (debug mode only) |
| `flush_once` | GET | – | Run one worker batch (debug mode only) |
| `trim_stream` | GET | `keep` | Approximate trim (debug mode only) |
| `health` | GET | – | Lag & status classification |
| `metrics` | GET | – | Cumulative saves/deletes + stream stats |
| `versions_list` | GET | `id, limit?` | List recent versions for a card |
| `version_get` | GET | `version_id` | Retrieve a specific version (id + metadata + text) |
| `version_restore` | POST | `{version_id}` | Restore version text into current card (new save event) |
| `version_snapshot` | POST | `{id}` | Manual snapshot (bypasses interval/size heuristics) |

All responses: `{ ok: boolean, ... }` or `{ ok:false, error: string }`.

### Validation & Limits

- IDs: hex (16–64 chars) or UUID v4; strict UUID enforced if `APP_REQUIRE_UUID=true`.
- Text length: capped by `APP_CARD_MAX_LEN` (default 256KB) → oversize returns `text_too_long`.
- Rate limiting: mutating endpoints limited per IP via Redis counters (`APP_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` per `APP_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`).

---

## Background Worker (`flush.php`)

- Reads stream with `XRANGE` batches (adaptive) in batch or continuous mode
- Coalesces events per card id before a DB transaction
- Missing hash ⇒ DELETE row; empty text (below `APP_EMPTY_MINLEN`) ⇒ pruned
- Updates `REDIS_STREAM_LAST` only after successful DB commit
- Trims stream every `APP_WORKER_TRIM_EVERY` processed events (approximate trim)
- Exposes stats (CLI output when run manually)

---

## History / Soft Delete

- Deleting a card removes its Redis hash + index membership (soft)
- Until the worker processes the stream entry (or detects absence) the MariaDB row remains
- History drawer lists DB rows whose ids are not in Redis so they can be restored or purged

---

## Security & Hardening

## Versioning & Backups

Renote implements lightweight, storage‑efficient version snapshots for each card. The goal: peace‑of‑mind recovery and diff inspection without a heavyweight VCS layer.

### Capture Points

1. Automatic on worker flush (write‑behind) for any card upserted whose content meaningfully changed since its last version snapshot.
2. Manual via the History drawer "Snapshot Now" button (always creates a snapshot, ignoring heuristics).

### Heuristics / Throttling

To prevent unbounded growth and noisy near‑duplicate versions:

- Minimum time interval between auto snapshots: `APP_VERSION_MIN_INTERVAL_SEC` (default 60s)
- Minimum character delta (absolute difference in length) to qualify: `APP_VERSION_MIN_SIZE_DELTA` (default 20 chars)
- Maximum stored versions per card: `APP_VERSION_MAX_PER_CARD` (default 25, newest kept)
- Optional age pruning (if set): `APP_VERSION_RETENTION_DAYS` – versions older than this are purged during insertion

These constants are defined in `Bootstrap.php` (migrate to env vars in a future iteration).

### Schema

Table `card_versions` (auto‑created lazily):

```text
card_id     VARCHAR(64)  NOT NULL
version_id  BIGINT       NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
txt         MEDIUMTEXT   NOT NULL
size        INT          NOT NULL
captured_at BIGINT       NOT NULL
origin      VARCHAR(32)  NOT NULL  -- 'flush' | 'manual'
INDEX (card_id, version_id DESC)
```

### API Usage

Fetch list (newest first): `GET ?action=versions_list&id=<card_id>&limit=25`

Get single version: `GET ?action=version_get&version_id=123`

Restore version: `POST ?action=version_restore {"version_id":123}`

Manual snapshot: `POST ?action=version_snapshot {"id":"<card_id>"}`

### Client UI

Open History → Versions tab:

- Select card (dropdown auto-populated from in‑memory state)
- View list of versions (timestamp, origin, size)
- Click version → inspect Raw or Diff vs current (inline line diff; additions green, deletions red)
- Restore or Copy from the action bar

### Diff Algorithm

Current implementation uses an in‑browser line‑based Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm with a safety cutoff (falls back to naive when line matrix would exceed ~160k cells to avoid freezing). Future enhancements may introduce word‑level granularity and performance optimizations (e.g., patience diff or Myers) for very large notes.

### Future Improvements

- Environment-driven configuration & documentation
- Optional compression for large historical texts
- UI filtering / search across versions
- Bulk export of a card's timeline

### Recovery Workflow Example

1. Flush runs; version snapshot captured (origin: flush)
2. User makes edits, then manually creates a snapshot (origin: manual)
3. Later discovers regression → open Versions, pick earlier snapshot, inspect diff, click Restore
4. Restored snapshot is written as the current card text (new save event), triggering a subsequent snapshot on next flush if heuristics satisfied

---

| Area | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Secrets | Keep `config.php` outside repo; mount or template it per env |
| Redis | Use UNIX socket with restricted group + ACL / password; enable AOF everysec |
| DB | Least privilege user limited to `cards` table; prefer UNIX socket |
| Input | ID + size validation enforced server-side (see API overview) |
| Output Escaping | JSON embedded via `safe_json_for_script` to prevent tag breakouts |
| Headers | Strong CSP (nonce), X-Frame-Options DENY, nosniff, strict referrer, trimmed Permissions-Policy |
| Rate Limiting | Enabled for mutating endpoints (tunable) |
| Future | Add per-card version limit & optional HTML sanitizer if markdown rendering added |

---

## Operations & Health

Health endpoint computes backlog estimates from `REDIS_STREAM_LAST` → classifies lag thresholds:

- ok: `< APP_WORKER_MIN_OK_LAG`
- degraded: `< APP_WORKER_MIN_DEGRADED_LAG`
- backlog: otherwise

In batch mode status relaxes if still within expected interval since last flush.

Systemd health timer (`docs/renote-health.service` / `.timer`) can curl the health endpoint and journal results.

---

## Development Tooling

Composer dev dependencies (after update): phpstan, phpunit, php-cs-fixer.

```bash
composer install
composer run lint     # (if script added)
composer test
```

Static Analysis (phpstan): Adjust level / paths in `phpstan.neon.dist`.

Coding Style (php-cs-fixer): Run `vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix` (dry‑run in CI first).

Testing: Basic smoke tests in `tests/` (extend with Redis integration tests using a disposable DB/schema).

Suggested CI steps:

1. validate composer (install --no-interaction)
2. php -l *.php (syntax)
3. phpstan analyse
4. phpunit

---

## Roadmap & Upcoming Work

- Markdown rendering & preview panel
- Lightweight WYSIWYG formatting (inline bold/italic/code, lists)
- Text size limit + graceful truncation warnings
- Full audit/event timeline (version history per card)
- Search (full‑text index via MariaDB or external engine)
- WebSocket push (live multi‑client sync)
- Multi‑user/auth (namespaces per user)
- Attachments (object storage + signed URLs)
- Export/import (JSON / Markdown bundle)

---

## Removed / Legacy Artifacts

Legacy prototype files have been fully purged in this refactor:

- `api.redis.php` (direct Redis prototype)
- `api.js` (superseded by `app.js`)
- `legacy/` directory

No migration steps required; production behavior unchanged for supported endpoints.

---

## Missing / Deferred Features (from early design notes)

Items described in earlier internal AI specification but not currently implemented or intentionally deferred:

- Continuous worker service mode (supported by code but not shipped with a dedicated continuous systemd unit in `docs/` yet)
- Rich text / markdown editing (planned)
- Versioned edit history per card (only latest state stored)
- WebSocket real‑time collaboration (currently poll + manual refresh pattern)
- Full security hardening (CSP, rate limiting, size quotas)
- Multi‑user authentication & per‑user isolation
- Attachments / file uploads
